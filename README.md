### Hi there 👋

As a student in machine learning and artificial intelligence with a multidisciplinary and scientific background (physics, mathematics and chemistry) I am interested in any kind of new project.

You can find on my profile 🔍:

- Two repository in Machine Learning and Machine Learning operations: dtu-mlops and peterampazzo/dtu-02476 📷👨‍💻. I was able to work on several MLOps methods for implementing and training models such as CI/CD (pytest, linting ...), using the cloud (google and AWS), and docker. The first one is a simple implementation of a convolutional network for MNIST. The second one is a model for recognizing the letters of the ASL alphabet (using Kornia transformations).

- Two repositories for an interactive application on Android Studio : playware and Patcast/PlaywareTwo 📲📳.

- On this link a study project I participated in about philosophers over the centuries : https://clam-xy.github.io/. Data query using the Wikipedia API, text analysis (sentiments, bag of words), graph analysis (greater component analysis and modelisation) 🧾👨‍👧‍👦.
